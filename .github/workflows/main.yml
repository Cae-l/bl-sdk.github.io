name: Mod Update

# Controls when the action will run. 
on:
  # Run every hour, on the hour 
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 * * * *" 

  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:

  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"

    steps:
      
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      # If this is running under a pull request, it will also pull in those changes
